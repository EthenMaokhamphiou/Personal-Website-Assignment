<h1>Home</h1>
<p>Welcome to my website!</p>
<p>My name is Ethen Maokhamphiou. I am an Asian American currently residing in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I am also a student at New Mexico's premier university, the University of New Mexico. Currently, I am studying as a dual major student in computer engineering and in computer science. Here you'll see my diverse portfolio. It is a curated collection of my favorite academic or hobby work.</p>
<p>On this website, there will be several ways to make contact with me through my socials. The best way to get into contact with me is through email. I check my email everyday. I am a busy college student, so expect a reply within one to two business days. I am open to any kind of business appointments that you may have for me. Whether that be a meeting in person or an interview.</p>
<p>Regarding some light information about myself. I have been around computers since I was young boy. My dad is an IT technician with his own business in the field. He is a man with hands in multiple fields. On top of his business in IT, he has different avenues of income such as owning properties. I think his go-getter atitude has heavily influenced who I am today. It has influenced my decision to become a dual major student and my decision to get involved with different student organizations. I feel it is better to keep busy rather than to become complacent and take the easy route in life.</p>
<p>At this moment in time, my porfolio is somewhat lacking in depth. It is moreso due to where I am in my academic career. I am currently getting through my prerequisite courses, so there will be less academic work and more hobby work that I've done. Expect to see more complex work in computer engineering and computer science.</p>
