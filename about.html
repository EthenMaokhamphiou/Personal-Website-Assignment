<h1>About</h1>
<p>My name is Ethen Maokhamphiou. I'm a sophomore student enrolled at UNM's School of Engineering for Computer Engineering. I've been around computers and technology my entire life. My dad is an IT Technician who runs a business doing a wide range of tech related jobs. Whether that be fixing internet issues, printers, or building computers to sell. My dad taught me all about his job and the things he would do. He would often bring me with him and would teach me while on the job. It was great traveling around New Mexico and was overall a fun experience that I had with my dad. I found a majority of technology rather fascinating, but was more interested in the computer side. Funnily enough, this interest stems from playing video games. I started with playing Halo on the original Xbox console and later moved to playing games like Counter Strike on a laptop. From there I wanted to learn all that I could about computers. Around high school I worked up enough money to buy my own Gaming PC. I decided against building it myself as prices for individual parts was just too expensive. After prices settled, a few of my friends grew interested in gaming and asked me about building their computers. Since then I've been building and maintaining a lot of PCs. For me it was pretty clear what I wanted to major in. The world of computers is ever evolving. Every year there seems to be a new and exciting piece of technology. The most substantial of which to me has been Ai and the most interesting to me has been VR. In my younger years, I never would have thought that people would be able to become so immersive.</p>
