<h1>Education</h1>
<p>Bachelor's of Computer Engineering and Computer Science (Dual Major)</p>
<p>University of New Mexico, Expected Graduation in Spring 2027</p>
<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to attend the University of New Mexico.My academic journey has been marked by growth and perseverance. I am not a perfect or top student in any regard. My failures define me as I work harder every day to overcome my personal challenges in academia. I take difficult obstacles in stride. Every semester I construct my intellectual identity. For me, the many classes I have taken are not characterized by the acquisition of facts but as transformative experiences. The countless hours of study has sculpted me into the person I am today. I am marked by the many perspectives and abilities that I have acquired over my young career. I have navigated diverse fields in the process of learning, and I am constantly inspired by those with more experience.</p>
<p>My whole life has been around computers. In my early, formative years, my interest in computers was influenced by playing video games. In my later years, my interest in computers has been influenced by the different advancements in technology. In my case those advancements have been felt through the evolution of gaming technology. Ai and VR have brought new experiences to those that pass their time through gaming. AI particularly has become important as the world looks to utilize its capabilities. I see myself becoming a part of the world's technological advancements. Possibly helping to develop new forms of Ai or utilizing its capabilites in different fields. On the other hand I can also see myself working to development new hardware or refining what already is in the world of technology. Regardless of what I end up choosing to do, I seek to further my knowledge in the ever evolving field of technology.</p>
